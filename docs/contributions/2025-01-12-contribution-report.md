## Recommendations

### For Project Management

**Immediate Actions (This Week)**:
1. **Intervention for Dyo Aristo**:
   - Schedule 1-on-1 meeting to understand blockers
   - Provide additional support/resources
   - Consider redistributing 1-2 tasks if needed
   - 17 hours backlog is project-critical

2. **Support for Muhammad Syahid Azhar Azizi**:
   - Check if help needed to start Saved Recipes module
   - Pair with Vointra or Zikri for guidance (both have 100% completion)
   - Set up daily check-ins until first task completed

3. **Unblock Code Reviews**:
   - Priority: Get Deni's task 3.4 complete so R.6 can proceed
   - Muhammad needs to complete 5.1-5.3 for R.6
   - Dyo needs to complete 6.1-6.7 for R.7
   - Consider assigning temporary reviewers if R. Purba is unavailable

**Medium-Term Actions (Next 2 Weeks)**:
1. **Git Workflow Training**:
   - Workshop for developers with zero commits
   - Emphasize importance of direct commits for attribution
   - Create Git cheat sheet for reference

## Methodology Notes

**Data Sources**:
- Git commit history: 46 total commits analyzed from 9 unique authors
- WBS task completion: 73 tasks tracked across 9 team members
- WhatsApp activity: 1,091 messages from 9 participants (excluding system and Meta AI)
- Subjective assessments: Based on observed contributions and role responsibilities

**Scoring Weights**:
- Git Commits: 30% (recognizing code contribution importance)
- WBS Tasks: 30% (recognizing delivery and reliability)
- WhatsApp Activity: 15% (recognizing communication and teamwork)
- Subjective Factors: 25% (recognizing intangible contributions)

**Assumptions**:
- "Lutfi Zain" and "lutfi.zain" combined as single contributor (same email)
- Merge commits counted toward merger's contribution (leadership role)
- Task completion weighted by priority (P0=3pts, P1=2pts, P2=1pt)
- WhatsApp score includes both message count and qualitative contribution
- Developers with no commits may have contributed via PRs not yet merged

**Adjustments Made**:
- Jumanta's Git score adjusted upward despite no direct commits (work completed via PR)
- R. Purba's lower score contextualized by reviewer role and blocks
- Vointra's low communication offset by perfect task completion
- WhatsApp activity normalized with message count as primary factor

**Limitations**:
- Subjective factors based on observable data only
- Some developers may be working offline or in branches
- WhatsApp activity may not reflect all communication channels
- Git commits may not capture all code contributions (PRs, etc.)

## Conclusion

The Resep Bunda React Native project shows strong leadership from Lutfi Zain and Syahrul Ramadhan, with excellent execution from Zikri Firmansyah and Vointra Namara Fidelito. However, significant concerns exist with three developers at 0% task completion (Dyo Aristo, Muhammad Syahid Azhar Azizi) and minimal Git participation from several team members.

**Key Successes**:
- Strong foundation and architecture in place
- 3 developers with perfect task completion
- Active leadership and communication from top contributors
- Working code review process

**Critical Risks**:
- Dyo Aristo: 17 hours pending, largest blocker to project completion
- Muhammad Syahid Azhar Azizi: 0% completion on Saved Recipes
- Multiple code reviews blocked, affecting final integration
- Three developers with zero Git visibility

**Recommended Focus**:
1. Immediate intervention for Dyo Aristo (largest backlog)
2. Support Muhammad Syahid Azhar Azizi to start Saved Recipes module
3. Unblock code reviews to enable final integration
4. Recognize and reward top performers (Zikri, Vointra)
5. Set clear expectations for Git participation and communication

The project can succeed if the critical path issues are addressed quickly and the team rallies to support struggling members.
