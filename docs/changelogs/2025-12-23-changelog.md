## Technical Debt Identified
| Item | Priority | Estimated Effort |
|------|----------|------------------|
| Type casting cleanup | High | 30 mins |
| Inline styles to StyleSheet | Medium | 1 hour |
| Add image fallback handlers | Low | 30 mins |
| Responsive height for header | Low | 45 mins |

## Upcoming Focus Areas
1. **Immediate**: Fix Task 3.4 INSERT statement
2. **Short-term**: Integrate real recipe data fetching
3. **Medium-term**: Add loading and error states

## Impact Assessment

**Positive Impacts**:
- Recipe Detail Screen UI ready for testing
- Consistent styling with rest of application
- Save/unsave infrastructure in place

**Areas of Concern**:
- Type safety needs improvement
- Dummy data should be replaced before QA testing

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Task 3.4 fix is straightforward (~1 hour)
- Database schema already supports the feature
- No architectural changes needed
